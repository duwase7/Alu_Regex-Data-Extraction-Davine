This project demonstrates a Python program that extracts structured data from raw text using regular expressions (regex).  
It emphasizes **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **security awareness**, handling realistic variations of data, including messy real-world text.

The sample input uses **Inyange Industries** as the example company to make the data realistic, similar to what a frontend application might receive from an external API or user input.
