This project demonstrates a Python program that extracts structured data from raw text using regular expressions (regex).  
It emphasizes **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **security awareness**, handling realistic variations of data, including messy real-world text.

The sample input uses **Inyange Industries** as the example company to make the data realistic, similar to what a frontend application might receive from an external API or user input.

 It includes:

- **Emails:** Employee or contact emails (e.g.,  `davine.uwase@inyange.rw`).  
- **URLs:** Company website links (`https://www.inyange.rw/support`).  
- **Phone Numbers:** Customer support or office lines in multiple formats.  
- **Credit Card Numbers:** Example payment data (masked in output for security).  
- **Times:** Meeting times in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.  
- **HTML Tags:** Example snippets from a web page or email.  
- **Hashtags & Currency:** Represent social media mentions and money values.
